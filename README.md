# Drone-Pathfinding-Delivery-System
This application functions by connecting to different endpoints from a REST server. Unfortunately, these servers are no longer available. It was packaged and built using Maven, and developed in Java.

Instead, some result files have been produced from previous runs of the system to prove it's functionality.

This system takes a date, and a base address of a REST server as parameters, and uses different endpoints to retrieve dynamic data for that program run. Data on the REST server is in JSON format, so the system has to make a connection to the server to retrieve the data, and then deserialise it.

The objective of the system is to deliver orders via drone for each day, by retrieveing information on orders from each day, and participating restaurants. There is also data for no-fly zones, which the drone cannot fly through, and a central area which the drone cannot leave once it enters it. All deliveries are made to a constant location, and the drone has a limited battery so it needs to maximise the deliveries done for that day. This is discussed in more details in the project specification.

A star patfinding

The implementation to find the quickest path to the restaurants is a modification of the A star algorithm, which creates nodes on the fly as there is no defined graph to traverse directly. The drone can only move in 16 arbitrary angles, so for each node created, the algorithm checks the 16 possible moves and gives each of them a score based on the distance travelled so far, the proximity to the objective and deletes the node if it is in a no-fly zone.
